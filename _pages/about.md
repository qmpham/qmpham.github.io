I am Research Engineer at SYSTRAN (Paris, France). I have recently defended my Ph.D. thesis in “Multidomain Neural Machine Translation.” I have been supervised by François Yvon, Senior Researcher at LISN/CNRS and Université Paris-Saclay. Many thanks to my thesis committee members, Rico Sennrich, Marine Carpuat, Alexander Fraser and Pierre Zweigenbaum.

My research interest mainly includes machine translation, multilinguality, and multi-domain problems in NLP. My work covers many aspects of the domain shift between train and test data.

Before my Ph.D. years, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique. I also obtained two diplomas, including an M.S. in Data Science from Université Paris-Saclay and an M.Eng. in Data Science from Télécom ParisTech.
