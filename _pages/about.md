I am Research Scientist at Zoom Video Communications (Karlsruhe, Germany). I defended my Ph.D. thesis in “Multidomain Neural Machine Translation” in December 2021. I was supervised by François Yvon, Senior Researcher at LISN/CNRS and Université Paris-Saclay, and Josep Crego, Head of Research at SYSTRAN. Many thanks to my thesis committee's members, Rico Sennrich, Marine Carpuat, Alexander Fraser, and Pierre Zweigenbaum. My thesis is [available here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03546910/).

My research interest mainly includes machine translation, multilinguality, and multi-domain problems in NLP. My work covers many aspects of the domain shift between train and test data.

Before my Ph.D. years, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (cursus d'ingénieur polytechnicien). I also obtained two diplomas, including an M.S. in Data Science from Université Paris-Saclay and an M.Eng. in Data Science from Télécom ParisTech.
