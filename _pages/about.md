I am Research Scientist at Zoom Video Communications (Karlsruhe, Germany). I defended my Ph.D. thesis in “Multidomain Neural Machine Translation” in December 2021. I was supervised by [François Yvon](https://fyvo.github.io/?n=Site.Enseignement), Senior Researcher at CNRS and Sorbonne Université, and [Josep Crego](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josep-m-crego-790b6b3/?originalSubdomain=fr), Head of Research at SYSTRAN. Many thanks to my thesis committee's members, [Rico Sennrich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/about-us/people/team/compling/sennrich.html), [Marine Carpuat](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/), [Alexander Fraser](https://www.cis.lmu.de/~fraser/), and [Pierre Zweigenbaum](https://perso.limsi.fr/pz/). My thesis is [available here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03546910/).

My research interest mainly includes multilingual Large language models and responsible AI. My work at Zoom focuses on the development of text summarization and machine translation services for Zoom Meeting and Zoom Team Chat.

Before my Ph.D. years, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique ([cursus d'ingénieur polytechnicien](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien#:~:text=Le%20Cycle%20Ing%C3%A9nieur%20polytechnicien%20de,l'Ecole%20polytechnique%2C%20coupl%C3%A9%20au)). I also obtained two other diplomas, including an [M.S. in Data Science](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/computer-science/m2-data-science) from Université Paris-Saclay and an M.Eng. in Data Science from Télécom ParisTech.
