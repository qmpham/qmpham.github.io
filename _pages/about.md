I am a Research Scientist in AI at Zoom Communications Inc. My work at Zoom focuses on the development of multilingual speechLLM models with application on speech translation and speech recognition.

I defended my Ph.D. thesis in “Multidomain Neural Machine Translation” in December 2021. I was supervised by [François Yvon](https://fyvo.github.io/?n=Site.Enseignement), Senior Researcher at CNRS and Sorbonne Université, and [Josep Crego](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josep-m-crego-790b6b3/?originalSubdomain=fr), Head of Research at SYSTRAN. Before my Ph.D. years, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique ([cursus d'ingénieur polytechnicien](https://programmes.polytechnique.edu/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien/cycle-ingenieur-polytechnicien#:~:text=Le%20Cycle%20Ing%C3%A9nieur%20polytechnicien%20de,l'Ecole%20polytechnique%2C%20coupl%C3%A9%20au)). I also obtained two other diplomas, including an [M.S. in Data Science](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/education/master/mathematics-and-applications/m2-data-science-health-insurance-and-finance-apprentissage) from Université Paris-Saclay and an M.Eng. in Data Science from Télécom ParisTech.
