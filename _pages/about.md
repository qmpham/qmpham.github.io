I am Research Scientist at Zoom Video Communications (Karlsruhe, Germany). I defended my Ph.D. thesis in “Multidomain Neural Machine Translation” in December 2021. I was supervised by [François Yvon](https://fyvo.github.io/?n=Site.Enseignement), Senior Researcher at CNRS and Sorbonne Université, and [Josep Crego](https://www.linkedin.com/in/josep-m-crego-790b6b3/?originalSubdomain=fr), Head of Research at SYSTRAN. Many thanks to my thesis committee's members, [Rico Sennrich](https://www.cl.uzh.ch/de/people/team/compling/sennrich.html), [Marine Carpuat](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~marine/), [Alexander Fraser](https://www.cis.lmu.de/~fraser/), and [Pierre Zweigenbaum](https://perso.limsi.fr/pz/). My thesis is [available here](https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-03546910/).

My research interest mainly includes machine translation, multilinguality, and multi-domain problems in NLP. My work covers many aspects of the domain shift between train and test data.

Before my Ph.D. years, I graduated from Ecole Polytechnique (cursus d'ingénieur polytechnicien). I also obtained two diplomas, including an M.S. in Data Science from Université Paris-Saclay and an M.Eng. in Data Science from Télécom ParisTech.
